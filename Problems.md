# Coulomb's Law

Two charged spheres 10 cm apart attract each other with a force of 3.0 x 10 6 N. What
force results from each of the following changes, considered separately?
a) Both charges are doubled and the distance remains the same.
b) An uncharged, identical sphere is touched to one of the spheres, and then taken far away.
c) The separation is increased to 30 cm.
