The [Physics 3D Interactive](https://effectuall.github.io/) is a growing collection of interactive 3D visuals for current and future generation of learners. It is a work in progress where contents are to be added as developed. In this website I hope to provide students, teachers and classrooms a collection of learning activities that are about engaging physics students in rich interactions. The website is created using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) JavaScript 3D Library, HTML and CSS. All contents are developed by me [E.P. Sajitha](effectuallearning@gmail.com). If you have any feedback regarding the contents, visualizations or if you have suggestions for a new simulation, please click on my name. 
I have compiled some of the visualization modules here at the [Physics Lab]( physicslab).
