# When in doubt with the concepts... 

Get your hands on this [3D interactive]( https://effectuall.github.io/) site available at [Github Pages]( https://github.com/online3d ) and follow along to
* understand 
* visualize 
* evaluate 

for all your doubt clearance.

### Check out the sample [microscope 3D](https://effectuall.github.io/) interactive and  more.

{% include embed.html url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/twhLLDENIS4" %}
Use controls
*  to show/hide the labelling
*  to show/hide the ray diagram
*  enable clipping for an interiot telescope view

Use mouse 

* to zoom and pan around in the 3D space
* to click on the microscope parts for the description

### Check out the simulation sample [circular motion 3D](https://effectuall.github.io/) interactive and  more.

{% include embed.html url= "https://www.youtube.com/embed/GOgbrGa_86Y" %}
Use controls
*  to pause/continue car animation
*  to select/unselect the vectors
*  to adjust the speed of car animation

Use mouse 

* to zoom and pan around in the 3D space
* to click on the microscope parts for the description

### Check out the interactive 3D simulation of [force on a current carrying conductor in a magnetic field ](https://effectuall.github.io/) and  more.

{% include embed.html url= "https://www.youtube.com/embed/2gCtgqUEBd4" %}

Play around with the parameters
* change current polarity
* flip magnetic polarity
* visualize the force direction etc.

The [Physics 3D Interactive](https://effectuall.github.io/) is a growing collection of interactive 3D visuals for current and future generation of learners. It is a work in progress where contents are to be added as developed. In this website I hope to provide students, teachers and classrooms a collection of learning activities that are about engaging physics students in rich interactions. The website is created using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) JavaScript 3D Library, HTML and CSS. All contents are developed by me [E.P. Sajitha](effectuallearning@gmail.com). If you have any feedback regarding the contents, visualizations or if you have suggestions for a new simulation, please click on my name. 
I have compiled some of the visualization modules here at the [Physics Lab]( physicslab).
